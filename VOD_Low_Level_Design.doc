Low-Level Design (LLD):

1. Component Diagram:
    * User Authentication Component
    * Video Metadata Database
    * Video Content Storage (S3)
    * Adaptive Bitrate Streaming Component
    * Video Encryption Component
    * Video Search 
    
2. Database Schema:
    * User Database: user_id, username, password (hashed), JWT tokens
    * Video Metadata Database: video_id, title, description, URL, encryption key
    * Elasticsearch index (if implementing video search)

3. API Design:
    * Authentication API: /user/login, /user/signup
    * Video Retrieval API: /videos/{video_id}
    * Video Search API :/videos

4. Authentication and Authorization:
    * Use JWT tokens for authentication.
    * Role-based access control: user, admin.

5. Content Storage:
    * Store video content in S3 buckets.
    * Use AWS Lambda to trigger encoding for adaptive streaming.

6. Error Handling:
    * Define error codes and messages for API responses.
    * Implement error logging.

7. Testing Strategy:
    * Unit tests for each component.
    * Integration tests for API endpoints.
    * Load testing for streaming.

8. Deployment and Infrastructure:
    * Use Docker containers for each component.
    * Orchestration with Kubernetes.
    * Use a CDN for content delivery.

9. Performance Optimization:
    * Caching for frequently requested videos.
    * Transcoding for adaptive streaming.
    * Content preloading.

10. Logging and Monitoring:
    * Implement logging for each component.
    * Monitor system health and performance using ELK stack.
    * Implement alerts for critical events.

11. Security Measures:
    * Implement HTTPS for API endpoints.
    * Use AES encryption for video content.
    * Implement rate limiting for API requests.

12. Error Recovery:
    * Implement backup and recovery strategies for S3 and databases.
    * Regularly test disaster recovery procedures.

13. Maintenance and Support:
    * Document maintenance procedures.
    * Set up a support system for user inquiries and issues.
