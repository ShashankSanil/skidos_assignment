High-Level Design (HLD):

1. Objectives and Requirements:
    * Objective: Develop a VOD microservice to serve fun learning videos to SKIDOS apps and the web platform.
    * Requirements: Secure access, adaptive bitrate streaming, video encryption, video search .

2. Architecture Overview:
    * Microservices Architecture
    * Components:
        - User Authentication
        - Video Storage
        - Adaptive Bitrate Streaming
        - Video Encryption
        - Video Search 

3. Data Flow:
    * Authenticated users request videos.
    * The microservice retrieves video metadata and content from storage.
    * Adaptive streaming adjusts video quality based on the user's device and network.
    * Encrypted video is streamed to the user's device.

4. Technology Stack:
    * Programming Language: Golang/Node.js
    * Frameworks: Go-Chassis,Gin-gonic,GoKit / LoopsBack,Express.js
    * Databases: PostgreSQL/MongoDB for user data, S3 for video storage
    * Video Streaming: FFmpeg for adaptive streaming
    * Encryption: HTTPS, AES encryption

5. Security:
    * User authentication via JWT tokens
    * Access control to ensure only authenticated users can access videos
    * HTTPS for secure data transmission
    * AES encryption for video content
    * Rate limiting to prevent abuse

6. Scalability:
    * Use containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes) for scalability.
    * Utilize a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for efficient video delivery.

7. Failover and Redundancy:
    * Implement load balancing and auto-scaling to ensure high availability.
    * Regular backups and disaster recovery plans.

8. Monitoring and Logging:
    * Use centralized logging (e.g., ELK stack) for monitoring and debugging.
    * Implement health checks and alerts for critical components.

9. API Documentation:
    * Document API endpoints for user authentication, video retrieval, adaptive streaming, and video search (if implemented).
    * Define request/response formats and authentication mechanisms.

10. Cost Estimation:
    * Estimate infrastructure costs, including storage, bandwidth, and third-party services.
    * Consider CDN costs.

11. Timeline and Milestones:
    * Define project milestones, including development, testing, and deployment phases.
